# Customer-satisfaction-statistical-analysis-r
An R-based data analysis project applying z-score normalization, outlier detection, and regression to model customer satisfaction from service ratings.

# 📈 Applied Statistical Analysis: Customer Satisfaction Modeling

This project uses **R** to analyze a customer satisfaction dataset by exploring the relationship between service quality factors and customer satisfaction scores using regression and descriptive statistics.

## 🧠 Techniques Used

- Data cleaning (missing value imputation with mean)
- Z-score standardization of variables
- Outlier detection using Z-scores
- Feature engineering (Satisfaction Score)
- Visualizations: Scatter plots, box plots, histograms, and correlation matrix
- Regression modeling (Multiple Linear Regression)

## 📊 Key Results

- Highest satisfaction correlated with **Cleanliness** and **Food & Drink** (r ≈ 0.77)
- Regression model showed strong fit (R² = 0.82)
- Significant predictors: Cleanliness, Food & Drink, and WiFi Service

## 🔧 Tools

- **Language**: R
- **Libraries**: ggplot2, dplyr, tidyr, corrplot

## 📁 Files

- `sample data set.csv` – Raw dataset
- `analysis_script.R` – Full R code used for analysis
- `Proj-report-1.pdf` – Final report with visualizations and interpretation

## 🚀 Outcome

This project demonstrates hands-on skills in statistical modeling, data cleaning, and EDA using R — ideal for roles in **data analytics**, **BI**, and **AI-driven customer insights**.
